# Vulnerability-Scanner
Vulnerability Scanner (Bash)
<h2>The main objective is to create a basic vulnerability scanner using a bash script to scan the network for open ports and services, map potential vulnerabilities and look for weak login passwords.</h2>

1. This is the project brief for the vulnerability scanner. I used comments to help the user of this script understand each function better.

2. At the start of the project, I used a combination of exec and trap commands to save the stdin, stdout and stderr into a file named vulner.log for logging purposes.

3. I proceed to download the dependencies required for this script to the /opt directory.

   Output in terminal: <br>

4. After downloading the necessary dependencies, I created functions to achieve the project objectives. <br>
   a. validate_ip function <br>

   b. validate_network function <br>

   c. host_discovery function <br>

   d. basic_scan function <br>

   e. full_scan function <br>

   f. map_vuln function <br>

   g. weak_passwords function <br>

   h. brute_services function <br>

5. After creating the functions, the script gets the user's input on the IP or Network to scan, and the username to check for weak passwords. These inputs are stored in variables.

   Output in terminal: <br>

   Invalid input: <br>

6. Asks the user for the directory to output scan results. Checks if the directory exists, change to that dir if it exists, or output to current dir if it doesn't.

   Output in terminal: <br>

   Invalid input: <br>

8. Use case to allow user to choose between basic or full scan. <br>
   a. Case statement: <br>

   b. Output in terminal (basic scan): <br>

   c. Output in terminal (full scan): <br>

   d. Invalid input: <br>

9. Areas of improvement <br>
   a. The first area would be conducting a more comprehensive check for dependencies required. Currently, I am just running commands to download it directly with apt-get or git clone, but it will be better if I can run a command such as ‘command’ or ‘locate’ to check if the required dependencies are already installed on the current system, before downloading it. <br>
   b. The second area would be having better logging for the script’s actions. This would include appending timestamps to each line or actions from the script, whether it is standard input, standard output, or standard error. <br>
   c. The third area would be implementing input validation for all user inputs, as this script requires much information from users, and having proper input validation would allow the whole process to run smoothly. <br>
   d. Lastly, I would like to implement better error handling for the script, so that if there are any errors at any point of running the script, it would be able to handle it gracefully.
